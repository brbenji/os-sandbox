# Holium - OS Sandbox

This is a limited version of Holium's OS environment for app developers to integrate with.

## Structure

There are three top-level folders in this repo.

- `ui`
- `desk`
- `sandbox`

Two of them (`ui`, `desk`) should be similar to the [`create-landscape-app`](https://github.com/urbit/create-landscape-app) project. The third, `sandbox` is the desktop environment emulator.

## Getting started

If you are starting from scratch, it may be useful to fork or copy this repo and begin building from here. If you already have a project, you can use the `.env` file in the `/sandbox` folder to connect to your locally running app.

Check out [`DEV_SETUP.md`](/DEV_SETUP.md) to get a fake ship running.
